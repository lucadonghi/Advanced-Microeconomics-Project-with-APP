# Interactive_paper
This Shiny App is an interactive representation of the economic paper "*Empirical analysis on price in Italian mobile telecommunication market: the Iliad effect*". 
This paper has been realized by me and a colleague of mine, Elisabetta Rocchetti, as part of a project for the *Advance Microeconomics* course. 
It aims to analyse the effect of the entry of Iliad in the **Italian mobile telecommunication market** and for further knowledge the paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IrFap4ghJhrOmIcOGX_kO4WO_Zvi2Yl6/view?usp=sharing).

## How to use the Interactive_paper
1. Make sure to install the `shiny` package.
2. Import `shiny` package.
3. If you don't have the other packages installed, running the Shiny App it will automatically check, install and load them. If it doesn't happen make sure to install also the following packages (and to import them): `pacman`, `readxl`, `rdrobust`, `ggplot2`.
4. Type this command in your RStudio console: `runGitHub("Interactive_paper","lucadonghi","master")`

## Shiny App composition
The app consists of two tabs displaying respectively mobile plans distribution and the econometric analysis.
### 1. Italian Mobile Telecomunication Tariffs
**This first tab is composed by:**
1. Brief **description** of the Shiny App.
2. The **description** of the selected dependent variable.
3. The **scatterplot** showing the distribution of the selected dependent variable on the timeline ("Days from Iliad entry").
4. Short **descriptions** of the selected operators.

**In the sidebar you can choose:**
1. The **dependent variable** of interest among the nine available: this selection will print the respective description and will change the dependent variable in the scatterplot.
2. The **time period** of interest between the 2000 days available: this choice will change the scatterplot zooming on the selected time period.
3. The **mobile operators** of which you want to display the observations: it will change the observations plotted in the scatterplot and it will print a short description of the selected operator.
### 2. Sharp Regression Discontinuity Design
**This second tab is composed by:**
1. A brief **description** of the econometric tecnique applied.
2. The **description** of the selected dependent variable.
3. The **Regression Discontinuity Plot** of the selected dependent variable on the timeline ("Days from Iliad entry").
4. Short text including the **estimated coefficient** of interest with its significance level.

**In the sidebar you can choose:**
1. The **dependent variable** of interest among the nine available: this selection will print the respective description and it will change the dependent variable in the RD Plot and in the Regression Discontinuity coefficient estimation.
2. The **cutoff** that will be used both in the RD Plot and in the Regression Discontinuity coefficient estimation.
3. The **polynomial degree** of the RD Plot.

## Files Description
[Dataset_Telecomunication.xlsx](https://github.com/lucadonghi/Interactive_paper/blob/master/Dataset_Telecomunication.xlsx) is the Excel file containing the collected data on which the Shiny App works. Data gathering has been performed for the economical paper drafting and you can find more information about this in the "*The_Iliad_effect*" PDF file.

[The_Iliad_effect.pdf](https://github.com/lucadonghi/Interactive_paper/blob/master/The_Iliad_effect.pdf) is the economical paper realized as part of a project for the Advance Microeconomics course. The entire Shiny App is based on it.

[functions_app.R](https://github.com/lucadonghi/Interactive_paper/blob/master/functions_app.R) is a R script containing few user-defined functions used in "*app.R*".

[app.R](https://github.com/lucadonghi/Interactive_paper/blob/master/app.R) contains the code used to run *Interactive_paper* shiny app.
